    Description: Sine we have covered some fundamentals, this example will cover functions.
    If you new to programming, function may sound complicated.  Think of function as a tool
    that you can use.  For an example - In a TV object, there will be a function called "Display", or "Change Channel", etc.

    <!-- Q1: Do you know the difference between Function and Method ? -->
    <!-- Q2: Do you know how scope works ? -->

            /*  Example 1 - Creating a basic alert function
                Let's create a basic alert function that accepts msg as parameter (or argument)
            */
            // To write a function, use the keyword 'function' and write statements inside {} (braces)
            function DisplayAlert(msg) { 
                // As I mentioned, JavaScript is case sensitive, if you write ("Function"), it will not work
                if (msg == "") {
                    msg = "You didn't enter anything";
                } // If there is msg argument cotains empty string, as default, display alert with 'You didn't enter anything' message
                window.alert(msg);
            } // End of displayAlert function

            /*  Example 2 - Creating a function that returns value 
                This function will return true or false.  Radio object, if you are familiar with HTML, can have multiple values.  Therefore, you need to loop through
                all available options and then check for its condition (checked).  The function is designed so that if checked, then return value of element inside list array */
            function Voted(answer) {
                for (let i = 0; i < answer.length; i++) {
                    if (answer[i].checked) {
                        return answer[i].value;
                    }

    <!-- Ans 1:     In JavaSCript, we use method if the function belongs to an object (instance of class - You will learn later) 
                    Example - alert and write are methods of object window -->
    <!-- Ans 2:     When you declare a variable inside a function, its scope is within the function, which means you cannot access that variable directly from outside of function.
                    If you want your variable to be accessed by multiple functions, it's better to declare the variable outside of all functions (Global declaration).
                    From my personal experience, unless your code is very simple and structured, it is not recommended to use global variable, especially if that variable
                    can be modified by multiple functions.  In later exercises, I will create getter and setter functions that set and get variables.
